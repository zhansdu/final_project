                            Starting from August 2020, SDU Library and Automation department teams were working on the project of library electronic catalog. This catalog was developed on the standards of the MARC 21 format for bibliographic data. To upgrade the available content, the library has hired 15 2-4th year student-assistants to our team.<br>
                            The daily responsibilities of students consists of:<br>
                            <ul>
                                <li>finding the information about each item of the library general collection;</li>
                                <li>filling in the material in the system;</li>
                                <li>locating items in the right order.</li>
                                <li>Besides the main responsibilities, the library organizes the training sessions for improving their professional skills and supports students active participation in them.</li>
                            </ul>
                            The project  will continue till September 2021.
