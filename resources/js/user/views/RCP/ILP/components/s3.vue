            To avoid being accused of plagiarism, you need to give credit to the
            concepts, facts, ideas and words you find from other sources and use
            in your papers. You give credit by properly using quotations or
            paraphrases and always providing correct citation and reference
            information whenever you do so. Plagiarism (latin Plaqio â€“ to steal,
            theft) is the acquisition of literary or scientific work by another
            author or the use of excerpts of the work without specifying the
            author. For instance, copying and pasting information to the content
            of a given assignment, adapting information and citing without
            indicating the source. Source: Academic Integrity Policy of SDU
